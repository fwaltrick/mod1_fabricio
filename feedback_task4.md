## General Feedback

Your code is nice and readable. I like that. The stucture is clear as well.
I saw that you got several .gitignore files in subdirectories. You can do that, but it's not neccessary. You can also add all your ignored files in the root's gitignore. Look into wildcards like \*\* or \* to optimize.


## Design

It a clean and simple design. Nice. The only thing i wonder: The header got a fixed with while the content shrinks on smaller screen sizes. Why not the same for both? Either is fine.

## Code

I added comments to the files. Please check.
